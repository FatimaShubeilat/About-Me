                    I am known for those who I feel comfortable with to have a gypsy soul, Hippie heart, Fairy spirit. 
                    Currently I am going after my dream in becoming a software developer, I have tried to do this by my own, but it appears to take too much time and effort in finding resources, beside a nice helpful communities to share my inforamtion, questions, and concerns with.
                    My next step is to get a job in a well established with a solid background that help me to become better, where it will be a win win.
